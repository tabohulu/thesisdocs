\begin{abstract}
For the {\it turbo code} (TC) consisting of  {\it recursive systematic convolutional} (RSC) codes, the complete knowledge of the low-weight codewords of the component code is very important for interleaver design to achieve a good performance. In this paper, we present a method to obtain complete information about low-weight codewords for  RSC codes. For a given RSC code, we first identify the codewords with weight-$2$ and weight-$3$ {\it parity-check components} (PCs) based on the characteristic of the feed-forward polynomial and similarly, we identify the codewords with low-weight {\it systematic components} (SCs) based on the feedback polynomial. The low-weight codewords are established from the identified codewords. To validate our proposed method, we obtain a union bound using the established low-weight codewords and compare it with that obtained via the transfer function and the {\it bit error rate} (BER) curve drawn from simulation results.
