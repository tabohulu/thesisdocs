%\section{Upper Bound Comparison of both methods}
%\label{sec5}

%In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, we compared the bit error rate (BER) upper bound the RSCC to results obtained through computer simulations. 

%There are a number of equations used to calculate the upper bound for the BER of a CC and these equations also apply to RSCC. For the case where the code is BPSK modulated and soft Viterbi decoding algorithm is used, the probability of bit error $P_b$ can be calculated using the equation below [3].

%\begin{equation}
%P_b \leq \frac{1}{k} \sum_{d=d_{\text{free}}}^{d_{\text{max}}} u(d) Q\Bigg( \sqrt{\frac{2dE_c}{N_0}}\Bigg)
%\label{eq5}
%\end{equation}
%where $u(d)=\sum_{w=1}^{\infty} w~ a(d,w)$,  $E_c/N_0$ is the Signal to Noise ratio for the transmitted codeword, $d_{\text{max}}$ is the largest value of $d$ used in the estimation of $P_b$ and $d_{\text{free}}$ is the free distance of the code. This equation require the knowledge of the distance spectrum of the RSCC and using the method described in the previous section,we obtain the partial distance spectrum for all input messages $b(x)$ of length $K=64$ which produce low-weight parity bits

%$h(x)$ where $w_H(\textbf{h})=2 ~\text{and} ~ w_H(\textbf{h})=4$.  We then use those terms with $d_{\text{max}}=8$ to calculate the probability of bit error using (\ref{eq5}). 

%For the simulation results we set $K=64$ and use a $5/7$ RSC encoder with tail-biting structure to encode the input messages. The codeword are BPSK modulated and transmitted over the AWGN channel. The soft Viterbi algorithm is used for the decoding and detection operation.

%		The simulation results are compared with the upper bound in Figure \ref{fig3}. 
%	We deduce that it is possible to estimate the performance of the RSC code by the upper bound obtained using our novel method. The difference between the upper bound and the simulation results is $1.3730 \times 10^{-4}, 2.9960 \times 10^{-5},2.2800 \times 10^{-6}, 1.5668^{-7}$ for $E_b/N_0$ (dB) values of $4,5,6~\text{and}~7$ respectively. 
%We observe that for $E_b/N_o$ value of  $6$ dB, the upper bound is x dB away from the simulation results whiles it is y dB from the simulation results at an $E_b/N_o$ value of  $6$ dB

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec6}
%In this paper,we presented a novel low-complexity method for determining the distance spectrum of any RSC code which has the added benefit of revealing the structure of the Return-To-Zero (RTZ) inputs that make up the distance spectrum as well as their corresponding parity-check sequences. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%We then go a step further and present a method  for deriving a general polynomial representation for both RTZ inputs and parity-check sequences with a Hamming weight of up to $4$ for any RSC code.
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
% Combining these two methods, we list the partial distance spectrum for selected RSC codes up to a cut-off weight $d_{\text{max}}$ and compare simulation results to the bounds obtained via our novel method and the regular method.

%In this paper, we presented a method for listing input message which produce codewords with low-weight parity bit sequences for a for a given $(n,k)$ RSC code. Compared to the Transfer function method, it has low complexity and provides more information about distance spectrum of the RSCC. Using a specially configured finite state machine, we can obtain a partial distance spectrum which we use to calculate an upper bound for the RSCC.  


In this In this paper, we presented a method for listing the partial distance spectrum for selected RSC codes up to a cut-off weight $d_{\text{max}}$ by focusing on codewords generated by RTZ inputs of weight $w_H(\bb) \leq 3$ as well as codewords with parity-check sequences $w_H(\bh) \leq 3$. Compared to the Transfer function method, it has low complexity and provides extra information with regards to the structure of the RTZ Inputs as well the parity-check sequences, which makes it very useful in interleaver design. We compared the bounds obtained using our novel method with the bounds obtained via the transfer function as well as simulation results for 3 RSC codes. Results suggest that considering codewords generated by RTZ inputs of weight $w_H(\bb) > 3$ as well as codewords with parity-check sequences $w_H(\bh) > 3$  will improve the accuracy of the bounds obtained via our method.
