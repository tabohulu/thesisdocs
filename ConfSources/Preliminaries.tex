\section{Preliminaries}
\label{secPrelim}

A polynomial in $x$, with degree $M$ and coefficients in $\cV$ is denoted by $v(x)$, and defined as 
\begin{equation*}
v(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{M} v_mx^m
\end{equation*}
$p$ represents a prime number and a Galois field with $p$ elements $\{0,~1,~\cdots,~p-1 \}$, is denoted by GF($p$). A Galois field with $p^M$ elements $\{0,~1,\cdots~p^M-1 \}$, denoted by GF($p^M$) is called the extension field of GF($p$) and GF($p$) is called the ground field of GF($p^m$).

$v(x),~v_M \neq 0$ with its coefficients taken from GF($p$) is defined over GF($p$) if the addition and multiplication of the coefficients are done modulo-p. 


\begin{definition}
Let $v(x)$ be a polynomial in GF($2$), then the Hamming weight of $v(x)$, represented by $w_H(v(x))$ is equal to the number of terms with non-zero coefficients.
\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}{Order of a polynomial \newline}
%The order of the polynomial $v(x)$ is equal to the highest degree non-zero coefficient  term.
%\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $v_M=1$, then $v(x)$ is a \textit{monic} polynomial. If $v(x)$ cannot be factorised into lower degree poynomials over GF($2$), it is an \textit{irreducible} polynomial. If $v(x)$ is both monic an irreducible, $v(x)$ is called a \textit{prime} polynomial.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
For non-zero elements  $\beta_m$ over GF($2^M$), $1 \leq m \leq 2^M-1$, the least positive integer value $\epsilon$ such that $(\beta_m)^{\epsilon}=1$ is known as the \textit{order} of $\beta_m$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Over GF($2^M$), $1 \leq m \leq 2^M-1$, non-zero elements  $\beta_m$ with order $\epsilon=2^M-1$ is called a primitive element.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $v(x)$ be a prime polynomial with degree $M$. If GF($2^M$) is constructed based on $v(x)$ and $\beta^1 = \beta$ is a primitive element, then $v(x)$ is a primitive polynomial. Alternately, if $v(x)$ does not divide $1+x^{\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon<2^M-1$, then it is a primitive polynomial. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $(e,~f)$ represent a pair of non-zero positive integers. Then $(e,~f) \bmod 2^M-1$ is shorthand for the operation $(e \bmod 2^M-1,~f \bmod 2^M-1)$.
\end{definition}



%$m$ is used to represent the order of $v(x)$ and GF($2^{m}$) represents the extended Galois field generated by a prime polynomial which has order $m$.
%$\beta^i$ represents a non-zero element in  GF($2^{m}$), $1 \leq i \leq 2^m-1$.
%Any $\beta^i \st (\beta^i)^j=1,~j\leq 2^m-1$ is know as a \textit{primitive element}


% an infinite repetition of the vector $\bv$ whiles $(\bv)_j$ represents the repetition of vector $\bv~j$ times   

%$\bphi$ represents a primitive element in the extended Galois field GF($2^{\tau}$) and the vector representation for all elements in GF($2^{\tau}$) are written as $\bphi_i,~0 \leq i \leq 2^{\tau}$. 

%The subscript $i$ represents the decimal value of the binary vector, which means $\bphi_0$ represents the all-zero vector. All addition and multiplication operations are done in GF($2^{\tau}$).

%The operation $(e \bmod M,~f \bmod M)$ is represented by $(e,~f) \bmod M$, where $(e,~f)$ are integer pairs.
