\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec6}
In this paper, we proposed a novel method for  obtaining the SCs and PCs ($2 \leq w_H(b(x)),w_H(h(x)) \leq 3$) of a low-weight RSC codeword, given the RSC code and a codeword cut-off weight, $d_{\text{max}}$.
Compared to the transfer function method, it has low complexity and the knowledge of the SC and PC patterns makes it a very useful for interleaver design. To validate our method, we compared the union bound obtained using our novel method with the union bound obtained via the transfer function as well as the simulation results for three RSC codes. Results suggest that RSC codes that can be sufficiently characterized by our novel method are much more attractive for use in TCs due to lower complexity required in the deterministic interleaver design.
