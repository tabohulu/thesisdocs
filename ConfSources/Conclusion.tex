\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec6}
%In this paper,we presented a novel low-complexity method for determining the distance spectrum of any RSC code which has the added benefit of revealing the structure of the Return-To-Zero (RTZ) inputs that make up the distance spectrum as well as their corresponding parity-check sequences. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%We then go a step further and present a method  for deriving a general polynomial representation for both RTZ inputs and parity-check sequences with a Hamming weight of up to $4$ for any RSC code.
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
% Combining these two methods, we list the partial distance spectrum for selected RSC codes up to a cut-off weight $d_{\text{max}}$ and compare simulation results to the bounds obtained via our novel method and the regular method.

%In this paper, we presented a method for listing input message which produce codewords with low-weight parity bit sequences for a for a given $(n,k)$ RSC code. Compared to the Transfer function method, it has low complexity and provides more information about distance spectrum of the RSCC. Using a specially configured finite state machine, we can obtain a partial distance spectrum which we use to calculate an upper bound for the RSCC.  


In this paper, we presented a method for listing the codeword pattern distance spectrum for selected RSC codes up to a cut-off weight $d_{\text{max}}$ by focusing on codewords generated by the RTZ inputs of weight $w_H(b(x)) \leq 3$ as well as codewords with parity-check sequences $w_H(h(x)) \leq 3$. Compared to the transfer function method, it has low complexity and provides extra information with regard to the structure of the RTZ inputs as well as the parity-check sequences, which makes it very useful for interleaver design. We compared the bounds obtained using our novel method with the bounds obtained via the transfer function as well as the simulation results for three RSC codes. The results suggest that considering codewords generated by RTZ inputs of weight $w_H(b(x)) > 3$ as well as codewords with parity-check sequences $w_H(h(x)) > 3$  will improve the accuracy of the bounds obtained via our method.
