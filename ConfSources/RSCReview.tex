\section{Union Bound of RSC Codes}
\label{sec2}
The outputs of an RSC code are determined by the input bit sequence $b(x)$, the states of the shift registers and the feedforward and feedback connections of shift registers that can be represented by a generator function. 

As an instance,  the generator function of a rate $1/2$ RSC code may be written as  $$\Big[1 ~\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\Big]$$ where $1$ yields the \textit{systematic  component} (SC) $b(x)$ while the \textit{parity-check component} (PC) $h(x)$ is associated with the feedforward and feedback connections of the shift registers, specified by  $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, respectively. The outputs $c(x)$ are a mixture of SC and PC as
\begin{equation}
c(x) = b(x^2)+xh(x^2)
\label{codeword-comp}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
h(x) =f(x)g^{-1}(x)b(x)
\label{eq:parity-def}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{codeword-comp}, we have
\begin{equation}
w_H(c(x))=w_H(b(x)) + w_H(h(x))
\label{eq:cw-weight}
\end{equation}
 and it is obvious that each low-weight codeword is a conjunction of two low-weight SC and PC.

Under the assumption of large frame sizes, the presence of $g^{-1}(x)$  in \eqref{eq:parity-def} may involve a particular sequence of bits that is repeated a large number of times, hence a high-weight PC. A low-weight PC occurs if and only if
\begin{equation}
b(x) \bmod g(x) \equiv 0
\label{eq:rtz-input}
\end{equation}
and the inputs $b(x)$ which meet the condition in \eqref{eq:rtz-input} is called a \textit{return-to-zero} (RTZ) input. Thus, every RTZ input can be factorized by  
\begin{equation}
b(x) =a(x)g(x)
\label{eq:low-weight-msg}
\end{equation}
where $a(x)$ is a monic polynomial, $a_0=1$.
Substituting (\ref{eq:low-weight-msg}) into \eqref{eq:parity-def}, we can characterize the low-weight PC as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
h(x)&=f(x)\cdot g^{-1}(x)\cdot a(x)g(x)\\
&=a(x)f(x)
\end{split}
\label{eq:low-weight-parity}
\end{equation}
%(quarantine)%Using both (\ref{novelEq2})  and (\ref{novelEq3}), we wish to list all low-weight codewords for a given RSC code.A low-weight codeword is any codeword which satisfies the condition, $w_H(\bc) \leq d_{\text{max}}$. This list is known as the \textit{partial structured distance spectrum}. To generate the partial structured distance spectrum, we take note of a few things. 

%From (\ref{novelEq2})  and (\ref{novelEq3}), we observe that $a(x)$ is a common factor in both equations and if we are able to solve for $a(x)$ via either of the equations, the remaining equation can be solved. To solve for $a(x)$ requires that in either equation, it should be the only unknown variable. At first glance, it might seem that $g(x)$ and $f(x)$ are the only known variables because they are dependent on the RSC code in question. However, if we remember that the weight of $h(x)$ and $b(x)$ is directly proportional to the number of terms it has, then we are on our way to obtain our second known variable. What is left is to determine the valid power values for the polynomial  terms, depending on the weight of $h(x)$ or $b(x)$.

Finally, for a given RSC code, we can formulate our goal as, to find all $a(x)$s which satisfy  \eqref{eq:low-weight-msg} and  \eqref{eq:low-weight-parity} simultaneously. However, since there is essentially no difference between the two equations, in the next section, we oresent a method for determining the low-weight PC patterns for $2 \leq w_H(h(x)) \leq 3$


 %an RSC encoder which takes in $k$ bits and outputs $n$ bits at every time instance.The output bits of an RSC code are generated using the feedforward and feedback connections of shift registers determined by its generator function. The generator function may be written in polynomial notation as $\Big[1 ~\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\Big]$, where $1$ yields the systematic (input) part  of the output while the parity check part of the output are specified by  $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that represent the feedforward and feedback connections of the shift registers respectively. Through out this paper, $c(x),~b(x)$ and $h(x)$ represesent the RSC codeword, the systematic component of the codeword and the parity check component of the codeword, respectively in polynomial notation.

%The minimum distance ($d_{\text{min}}$) of the RSC code determines its error-correcting capability. With the aid of the distance spectrum, it is possible to determine $d_{\text{min}}$ as well as its multiplicity. The most common way to find the distance spectrum is via the transfer function of the RSC code. The transfer function enumerates all the paths that diverge from and then return to the initial state \cite{ref3}, \textit{i.e.} the RTZ inputs. In other words, the distance spectrum provides information about the number of codewords of weight $d$ generated by an RTZ input of weight $w$. 

%Also to obtain the distance spectrum requires an extra division operation. In the case of interleaver design for turbo codes, this method for generating the distance spectrum is not particularly useful. This is because it reveals no extra details with respect to the structure of the RTZ inputs. 
%Next, we present our novel method, whose complexity is independent of the number of states in the RSC code. As an added bonus, information regarding the structure of the RTZ inputs can be obtained using this method.

%\begin{example}		
%An RSC encoder is shown in Figure \ref{fig1} with $k=1$ and $n=2$. Its parity generator\newline function is given by $[\frac{1+x^2}{1+x+x^2}]$, which may be written as $5/7$ in octal form, where $5 ~ \text{and} ~ 7$ correspond to the numerator and denominator of the generator function, respectively. 
 %For this RSC code, the cycle is $\bphi_g=\bphi_6 $ with a cycle length $\tau =3$. While $\bphi=(1~1~1~ 0~ 1~ 1~ 0~ 1~ 1~ 0~\cdots)$, which may be written in terms of the elements of GF(8) as $\bphi_7~\dot{\bphi_3}$ represents the impulse response. 
 %\end{example}
 % Moving forward all other examples and discussions relating to RSC codes will be done using the $5/7$ RSC code unless otherwise stated.

 %The knowledge of $\textbf{p}$ and $\tau$ will be used in deriving the method for determing which input messages generate low-weight parity bits.
