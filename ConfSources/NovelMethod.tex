\section{The patterns of the low-weight PCs}
\label{sec3}

To determine the detail patterns of the low-eight PCs, we assume $f(x)$ can be factorized by $K$ minimal polynomials as 
\begin{align}
f(x)&=\prod_{k=0}^{K-1}f_{\beta_k}(x)
\end{align}
where $\beta_k$ is a root of $f_{\beta_k}(x)$ of order $\epsilon_k$.
Then, \eqref{eq:low-weight-parity} implies that each $\beta_k$ is also a root of $h(x)$.
