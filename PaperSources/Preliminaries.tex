\section{Preliminaries}
binary vectors are represented by bold font and $\dot{\bv}$ represent an infinite repitition of the vector $\bv$ whiles $(\bv)_j$ represents the repitition of vector $\bv~j$ times   

$\bphi$ represent a primitive element in the extended Galois field GF($2^{\tau}$) and the vector representation for all elements in GF($2^{\tau}$) are written as $\bphi_i,~0 \leq i \leq 2^{\tau}$. 

The subscript $i$ represents the decimal value of the binary vector, which means $\bphi_0$ represents the all zero vector. All addition and multiplication operations are done in GF($2^{\tau}$).

The impulse response for a RSC code is given by $\btheta$ and the cycle of the RSC code and the associated cycle length is given by $\bpsi$ and $\tau$ respectively. $\btheta,~\bpsi$ and will be properly defined in the next section.
