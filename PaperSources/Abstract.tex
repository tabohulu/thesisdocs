\section{Abstract}
The knowledege of the distance spectrum, as well as the structure of the message inputs that make up the distance spectrum for a specific Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) code is vital to the design of Turbo Code interleavers. Whiles the distance spectrum of a RSC code can be obtained by calculationg its transfer function, it provides no information about the structure of the message inputs. %and the complexity involved in calculating the transfer function increases with the number of states of the RSC code.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper,we present a novel low-complexity method for determining the distance spectrum of any RSC code which has the added benefit of revealing the structure of the message inputs that make up the distance spectrum.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 With the knowledge of the structure of the message inputs, we derive a general polynomial representation for them based on the weight of the message input after which we go a step further and show how to derive their corresponding parity-weight equations.
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
 Finally, a summary of the structure of the message inputs as well as their corresponding parity weight equations is tabulated for different RSC codes.
%Finally, we compare the upper bound for both methods to simulation results and it is revealed that the upper bound obtained by the novel method is much tighter.
