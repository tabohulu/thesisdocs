\begin{abstract}
For the turbo code (TC) consisting of  recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes, the complete knowledge of the low-weight codewords of the RSC code is very important for interleaver design in order to achieve good TC performance. In this paper, we present a method to determine the patterns of low-weight codewords for  RSC codes. For a given RSC code, we first identify the codewords with weight-$2$ and weight-$3$ parity-check components (PCs) based on the characteristic of the feed-forward polynomial. Similarly, we identify the codewords with low-weight systematic components (SCs) based on the feedback polynomial, and then establish the low-weight codewords from the identified codewords. To validate our proposed method, we obtain a union bound using the established low-weight codewords and compare it with that obtained via the transfer function method and the bit error rate (BER) curve drawn from simulation results.
