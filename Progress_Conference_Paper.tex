\begin{abstract}
%Knowledge of the distance spectrum, as well as the structure of the message inputs that make up the distance spectrum for a specific recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code is vital to the design of Turbo Code interleavers. Even though the distance spectrum of an RSC code can be obtained by calculating its transfer function, it does not provide any information about the structure of the message inputs. %and the complexity involved in calculating the transfer function increases with the number of states of the RSC code.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper, we present a novel low-complexity method for determining the pattern of the low-weight codeword components of any RSC code as well as the distance spectrum. 
Using our method, we list the partial distance spectrum for selected RSC codes up to a cut-off weight $d_{\text{max}}$ and compare the simulation results to the bounds obtained via our novel method and the transfer function method.

%\section{Upper Bound Comparison of both methods}
%\label{sec5}

%In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, we compared the bit error rate (BER) upper bound the RSCC to results obtained through computer simulations. 

%There are a number of equations used to calculate the upper bound for the BER of a CC and these equations also apply to RSCC. For the case where the code is BPSK modulated and soft Viterbi decoding algorithm is used, the probability of bit error $P_b$ can be calculated using the equation below [3].

%\begin{equation}
%P_b \leq \frac{1}{k} \sum_{d=d_{\text{free}}}^{d_{\text{max}}} u(d) Q\Bigg( \sqrt{\frac{2dE_c}{N_0}}\Bigg)
%\label{eq5}
%\end{equation}
%where $u(d)=\sum_{w=1}^{\infty} w~ a(d,w)$,  $E_c/N_0$ is the Signal to Noise ratio for the transmitted codeword, $d_{\text{max}}$ is the largest value of $d$ used in the estimation of $P_b$ and $d_{\text{free}}$ is the free distance of the code. This equation require the knowledge of the distance spectrum of the RSCC and using the method described in the previous section,we obtain the partial distance spectrum for all input messages $b(x)$ of length $K=64$ which produce low-weight parity bits

%$h(x)$ where $w_H(\textbf{h})=2 ~\text{and} ~ w_H(\textbf{h})=4$.  We then use those terms with $d_{\text{max}}=8$ to calculate the probability of bit error using (\ref{eq5}). 

%For the simulation results we set $K=64$ and use a $5/7$ RSC encoder with tail-biting structure to encode the input messages. The codeword are BPSK modulated and transmitted over the AWGN channel. The soft Viterbi algorithm is used for the decoding and detection operation.

%		The simulation results are compared with the upper bound in Figure \ref{fig3}. 
%	We deduce that it is possible to estimate the performance of the RSC code by the upper bound obtained using our novel method. The difference between the upper bound and the simulation results is $1.3730 \times 10^{-4}, 2.9960 \times 10^{-5},2.2800 \times 10^{-6}, 1.5668^{-7}$ for $E_b/N_0$ (dB) values of $4,5,6~\text{and}~7$ respectively. 
%We observe that for $E_b/N_o$ value of  $6$ dB, the upper bound is x dB away from the simulation results whiles it is y dB from the simulation results at an $E_b/N_o$ value of  $6$ dB
