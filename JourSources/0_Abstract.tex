	The  {\it recursive systematic convolutional} (RSC) code is widely used as the component code of high-performance error correcting codes and the complete knowledge of the low-weight codewords of the employed RSC code is very important for the construction of the code to achieve a good performance. In this paper, referring to the generator function of RSC code, we present a method to obtain complete information about low-weight codewords of RSC codes. To this end, we first identify the codewords with weight-$2$ and weight-$3$ {\it parity-check components} (PCs) based on the characteristic of the feed-forward polynomial, and similarly, those with low-weight {\it systematic components} (SCs) based on the feedback polynomial. The low-weight codewords are established from the identified codewords. To validate the proposed method, we obtain a union bound using the established low-weight codewords and compare it with that obtained via the transfer function and the {\it bit error rate} (BER) curve drawn from simulation results.
