\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec6}
In this paper, we proposed a method to determine the patterns of low-weight codewords of an RSC code. We established the low-weight codewords by identifying codewords with SCs or PCs of weight-$2$ and weight-$3$. We validated our proposed method by obtaining a union bound using the established low-weight codewords and compared it with that obtained via the transfer function method and the BER curve drawn from simulation results.
