\section{Preliminaries}
\label{secPrelim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A polynomial in $x$ with degree $M$ is an expression of the form
\begin{equation}
v(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{M} v_mx^m
\label{Eq:polynomial}
\end{equation}
where $v_m,~0 \leq m \leq M$, are called the \textit{coefficients} and $v_M \neq 0$. If $v_M=1,~v(x)$ is called a \textit{monic} polynomial. 

\item We call the total number of the non-zero coefficients the \textit{Hamming weight} of $v(x)$, denoted as $w_H(v(x))$.

\item For a prime number $p$, if the addition and multiplication of two elements in the integer set $\{ 0,1,p-1\}$ are performed on the terms $\bmod~p$, we call the set a Galois field, denoted as $\GF(p)$. If the coefficients in \eqref{Eq:polynomial} are elements of $\GF(p)$, $v(x)$ is called a {\it polynomial over} $\GF(p)$.

\item For two polynomials $v(x)$ and $w(x)$ with degrees $M$ and $N$, respectively, the addition and multiplication over $\GF(p)$ are defined as 
\begin{align}
v(x)+w(x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\max\{ M,N\}} [(v_m +w_n)\mod p] x^m
\label{Eq:addition}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
v(x)w(x)=\sum_{m=0}^{ M+N} \sum_{i=0}^{m} [v_i w_{m-i}\mod p]x^m
\label{Eq:multiplication}
\end{align}
respectively. 

\item We say a monic polynomial is a \textit{prime polynomial} if it cannot be obtained by the multiplication of some lower degree polynomials.

\item For two polynomials $v(x)$ and $w(x)$ over $\GF(p)$, $w(x) \neq 0$, there exists polynomials $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ 
over $\GF(p)$ such that 
\begin{align}
v(x) = w(x)q(x)+r(x)
\label{Eq:decomposition}
\end{align}
with $\deg(r(x)) < \deg(w(x))$. We represent $r(x)$ in the expression \eqref{Eq:decomposition} as
\begin{align}
r(x) \equiv v(x)\mod w(x)
\end{align}
and call it the \textit{remainder polynomial}, while $q(x)$ is called the \textit{quotient polynomial} of the division of $v(x)$ by $w(x)$.

\item Let $v(x)$ be a prime polynomial over $\GF(p)$ with $\deg(v(x)):=M>1$ and $\cV$ be the set of size $p^M$ containing all polynomials over $\GF(p)$ with degree less than $M$. Then, the \textit{extension field of $\GF(p)$}, denoted by $\GF\left(p^M\right)$, is the set $\cV$ with addition and multiplication over $\GF(p)$, where the multiplication is carried out modulo-$v(x)$ over $\GF(p)$.

\item Each non-zero element in $\GF \left(p^M\right)$ can be represented by a power of $x$ uniquely as $x^m,~0 \leq m \leq p^M-1$. 

\item For each non-zero element of $\GF \left(p^M\right)$, there exist integers $\epsilon$ such that $x^{\epsilon}=1$ and the least positive integer among them is called the \textit{order} of $x$. We say that elements with order $\epsilon=p^M-1$ are \textit{primitive elements}. 

\item For $\GF \left(p^M\right)$ generated by a prime polynomial $v(x)$ with $\deg(v(x))=M$, if $x$ is a primitive element in $\GF \left(p^M\right)$, then  $v(x)$ is called a \textit{primitive polynomial}. 
%

\item Finally, the root of $v(x)$, is the non-zero element $\varphi,~\varphi \in \GF \left(p^M\right)$ such that $v(\varphi)=0$. If $v(x)$ is a primitive polynomial, the order of $\varphi$ is $\epsilon=p^M-1$, otherwise $\epsilon | p^M-1$. 
Moreover, the elements $\varphi^i,~0 \leq i \leq \epsilon -1$, are all distinct from each other.
 \end{enumerate}
%Finally, let $(e,~f)$ represent a pair of non-zero positive integers. Then $(e,~f) \bmod 2^M-1$ is shorthand for the operation $(e \bmod 2^M-1,~f \bmod 2^M-1)$.
